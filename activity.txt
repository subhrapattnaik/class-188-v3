Phase 1: Empathize\

We will be making a flight simulation app.\
● This can help aspiring pilots to train themselves better. People who want to know how it
feels to fly a plane without being an actual pilot will love this.\
● This can also allow the younger generation to have a fun game to play\


-------------------------------------

Phase 2: Defining \
we will be making a virtual reality flight simulation app to help aspiring pilots.\
● We might face the challenge of managing a heaving application\

--------------------------------------
Phase 3: Ideation\

we will be needing a VR development Framework/library.
● We can add a timer.
● We can add scores
● We can add obstacles. This will require physics.
----------------------------------------

Phase 4: Prototyping \
we can design/build a prototype (how the actual product will be) based on the following element, for virtual reality application, we will need:\
● Scene\
● Game rules\
● Flight controls\
● Player movement\
● Points to the players\
● Single player\
● 3D collisions\
● Timer\
● 3D Text\

--------------------------------------------

This will result in the first version of the actual product that can be tested.\

Phase 5: Testing\
We should be able to run the prototype successfully; if not, then we should cross-check by asking the questions\
such as:\

● Issues coming to the trial run?\
● How can we fix them?\
● Can we improve this prototype,\
or do we need a new idea?\
● Did we try it with the end users?\
● What was the user's reaction to the product?\
